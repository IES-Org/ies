# The IES Ontology

IES was developed by the UK Government with contributions from Dstl, Ministry of Defence, Metropolitan Police Service, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Home Office, Department for Business and Trade (was BEIS), and HMRC, with technical support from Aurora Consulting (to Home Office) and Telicent (to Dstl).

This repo provides public access to the IES for collaboration purposes including the specification itself, sample data/code and supporting documentation. There is also a private repo used for the management of the IES; please get in touch if you require access, for example to submit formal Change Requests.
