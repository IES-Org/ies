# What is IES?

**A unified approach for seamless data exchange**

The Information Exchange Standard (IES) is an open, structured framework designed to enable consistent and interoperable data exchange across multiple sectors, including buildings, infrastructure (currently encompassing aspects of transport water and energy), defence and national security.

IES provides a common ontology for describing entities, events, relationships, and metadata in a standardised and structured manner. By leveraging semantic web principles (RDF, BORO methodology), IES ensures that data is not only well-defined but also context-aware and machine-readable.

# Why IES matters?

**Standardising data exchange for cross-domain interoperability**

Data fragmentation and inconsistency pose significant challenges to collaboration, analysis, and automation. IES addresses this by:

- Supporting governance and compliance through structured, extensible models
- Providing a shared vocabulary that different systems can interpret
- Facilitating seamless data integration across industries and platforms
- Reducing complexity in information sharing, making processes more efficient and scalable

# Who uses IES?

The IES framework is highly adaptable and is already being adopted across various domains, including:

**Currently, parts of the built environment (including buildings, infrastructure, and utilities), defence, and national security**

- Government & Policy Making – facilitating cross-agency data collaboration
- National Security & Defence – enabling structured intelligence-sharing and situational awareness
- Buildings and infrastructure – enhancing Digital Twins and asset management, and ensuring interoperability across sectors
- Service provision – standardising data for service provision – for example in transport services provision and energy flexibility markets

# How can I get involved?

IES is an evolving and collaborative initiative, welcoming contributions from professionals across diverse sectors. You can:

1. Explore our repositories to gain insight into how IES works in practice
2. Join a domain working group to help shape the standard for your industry
3. Collaborate with organisations to drive adoption and integration across sectors
4. Contribute to the model by proposing improvements, extensions, and refinements

## About this repository
 
This repository is part of the Information Exchange Standard), a UK Government initiative to support consistent and open data exchange. While the Information Exchange Standard is not a legal entity, it represents a collaborative effort across multiple UK government bodies, including (but not limited to) the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (dstl), Ministry of Defence (MOD), Metropolitan Police, Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), Home Office (HO), and HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).
 
The Department for Business and Trade is the current custodian of this GitHub repository and the Information Exchange Standard GitHub organisation. However, the work itself reflects the collective contributions of multiple government bodies, with technical support from private sector organisations and subject matter specialists. These contributors are formally recognised in the ‘ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md’ file.
 
The GitHub Enterprise environment hosting this repository includes individuals and representatives from across these organisations, supporting a shared development approach.
