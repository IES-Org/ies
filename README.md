# Information Exchange Standard (IES) Ontologies

This repository hosts the documentation and specifications for the Information Exchange Standard (IES) ontologies. These RDF ontologies provide standardized vocabularies and semantics for information exchange. The documentation is served via GitHub Pages at [add-your-github-pages-url-here].

## Ontology Structure

The IES is composed of several interconnected ontologies:

- `/iescommon` - Core concepts and shared vocabulary
- `/iesbuild` - Concepts and relations about the built environment
- `/iesinfra` - Infrastructure in the built environment
- `/iesnsd` - security and defense concepts
- `/iespeople` - People, organizations, and roles
- `/iessystems` - Systems and components descriptions

Each ontology maintains versioned documentation under `v1.0`, `v1rc`, etc.

## Documentation Access

The ontology documentation is hosted using GitHub Pages. Each ontology section includes:

- Concept definitions
- Property descriptions
- Usage examples
- Version history

## Versioning

Each ontology follows semantic versioning:
- `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0`, etc. - Stable releases
- `v1.0.0rc`, `v2.0.0rc`, etc. - Release candidates
